            <p>In computer science algorithmic efficiency is a property of
                of an algorithm which relates to the number of computational
                resources used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed
                to determine its resource and the efficiency of an algorithm 
                can be measured based...

            <p>In earlier computing models like client-server the processing load
                the application was shared between code on the server and code installed
                on each client locally. In otber words an application, had its own
                pre-complided client program which served as its user interface and
