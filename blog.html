        <p class="description">
          In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an
          algorithm which relates to the number of computational resources used
          by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed to determine its
          resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured
          based...

        <p class="description">
          In earlier computing models like client-server, the processing load
          for the application was shared between code on the server and code
          installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had
          its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user interface
          and had to be...
