            In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an
            algorithm which relates to the number of computational resources
            used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed to determine
            its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be
            measured based ...

            In earlier computing models like client–server, the processing load
            for the application was shared between code on the server and code
            installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had
            its own pre-compiled client program which served as its user
            interface and had to be...
